			<h2>What are your career aspirations following your undergraduate studies?</h2>
			<p>After I receive my Bachelors in computer science, I plan to slowly work my way up the Tech world. Starting with being a junor web designer, getting some hands on experience. From there I hope to move on to making video games for a well known company. Eventually creating my own video game company.</p>
			<h2>How will you contribute to the strong scholarship that Theta Chi Offers?</h2>
			<p>I believe that joining Theta Chi was a great decision, and its just getting started! For someone to not enjoy the same experience due to financial reasons is a something I would like to help prevent. For now, being the broke college student that I am, I cannot help with money. However, time is something I can contribute. Emailing alumn asking for donations, or hosting fundraisers is a couple of ways I can contribute. Eventually after college donations would be more of a possibility. </p>
			<h2>How will this scholarship make you become a better Theta Chi?</h2>
			<p>Being a better Theta Chi to me means being extremely active in the chapter. This scholarship would further enable me to do just that. With the financial burden off my shoulders attending mixers, representing Theta Chi at philanthropy events, and being able to afford stich would become easier.  </p>
			<h2>In your own words, what makes someone a good scholar?</h2>
			<p>When I hear the word scholar, I think back to the greek philosophers. They dedicated their life to studying a particular subject. What makes someone a good scholar is their persistents in becoming better at a specific thing, just like the greeks. </p>
			<h2>What do truth, temperance, and tolerance mean to you and how do apply them in your everday life?</h2>
			<p> For me truth, temperance, and tolerance describes a gentleman. Being a gentleman is when you accidentally hit the toilet seat as you're taking a piss, and you clean it up. It's taking care of the little things that no one else would know about. Always telling the truth when you get called out for something. Or saying no to a dangerous situation.</p>
